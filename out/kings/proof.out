Proof of query:
All of the following clauses are derived from the knowledge base by resolution.

PREVIOUS CLAUSES (before iteration 3)
~(King(x))
~(Greedy(x))
Evil(x)
(~(King(x)) v ~(Greedy(x)))
(Evil(x) v ~(King(x)))
(Evil(x) v ~(Greedy(x)))
~(Evil(John))
Brother(Richard, John)
Greedy(John)
King(John)
((~(King(x)) v ~(Greedy(x))) v Evil(x))


FINAL CLAUSES (from iteration 3)
Evil(x)
~(Greedy(x))
~(King(x))
(Evil(x) v ~(Greedy(x)))
(Evil(x) v ~(King(x)))
(~(King(x)) v ~(Greedy(x)))
{ } (empty clause)

Having derived the empty clause with resolution, by the Ground Resolution
Theorem, the query is proven.
Note that each of the FINAL CLAUSES (including the empty clause) was
derived by resolution on two of the PREVIOUS CLAUSES.
