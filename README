Notes, Quirks, and Irregularities:
- As per section 9.5.5 of AIMA, one must axiomatize equality by hand. This
  is counter-intuitive, but implementing demodulation or paramodulation is 
  beyond the scope of this project.
  To do so, add the three basic axioms at the beginning of math.fol and then
  one corresponding axiom for each relation or function in the knowledge base.
